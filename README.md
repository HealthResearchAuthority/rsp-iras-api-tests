# Introduction
This is the repository that will contain the Automated API Tests for the HRA IRAS project

The Tests are written in JavaScript as part of a Postman Collection using the Postman Sandbox environment.

The most recent version of the Postman Collection is exported as a JSON file from our teams Postman workspace and added to this repository.

This is to:
- Back-up the test scripts and store them in a controlled, secure, and managed platform.
- Allows us to run the Collection as part of a CI/CD Azure DevOps pipeline.

The Tests can be run locally on the Dev Box via the Postman Collection runner
